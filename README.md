## Business Outcome

The primary goal of this fraud detection system is to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time, which can help businesses minimize financial losses and enhance customer trust. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system aims to:

- **Reduce False Positives**: Improve the accuracy of fraud detection to ensure legitimate transactions are not mistakenly flagged.
- **Enhance Security**: Provide a robust tool for financial institutions to safeguard against fraudulent activities.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Streamline the fraud detection process, allowing for quicker responses to suspicious transactions.
- **Improve Customer Satisfaction**: By reducing false alarms and ensuring a smooth transaction experience, customer trust and satisfaction can be enhanced.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Bootstrap (for frontend)
- Joblib (for model serialization)

Models
The project includes the following models:

Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Both models are trained on the processed dataset and saved as pickle files in the models directory.
